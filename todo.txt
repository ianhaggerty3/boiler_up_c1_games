Respond to being scored on based on health lost
    1. If the enemy scores at an edge, it makes sense to blob upgraded walls there to force them more to the middle
    2. If the enemy scores in the middle, it would be cool if we could find a way to put more turrets along their path.
       like, usually only one normal turret and then another response turret attack those enemies. But, if we spawned
       turrets along the path we know they take to get there, we could do a lot more damage.
Better prioritize what to do
    1. Right now, we are using all of our resources, but not in a very smart way. For example, we keep trying to build
       factories instead of beefing up defence around where we are scored on
    2. It would be cool to have a priority queue of what to do, or maybe push reactive defense up in trying to do that
       stuff before other stuff
Write a function that figures out where to best intercept enemies based on where they are spawning
Write a function that scans along the edges and determines the easiest place to score, possibly in 2x2 blocks
Write a function that figures how best to reach that scoring area (could be related to the intercept function)
    1. I made a set of edge paths, which correspond to where we are allowed to spawn things. We could try seeing where
       each spawn location takes us, and compare that to the easy to score places. Depending on how efficient it is
       to compute that stuff
