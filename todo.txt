Respond to being scored on based on health lost
Write a function that figures out where to best intercept enemies based on where they are spawning

1. try adding early demolishers back
2. respond to breakthroughs in the wall better, based on where we got to the wall
3. see how many scouts or demolishers it takes to take out one upgraded wall
4. see if we die to interceptors, and if so, add the unit stalling strat
5. blob walls on where they will probably break through soon
